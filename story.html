          <p>Hey there my name is Stephen Caulfield and I love puzzles. You may have noticed I have a small interest in Erno Rubik and the cube of his namesake. The aesthetic of Erno's puzzle has always drawn my eye and captivated my curiosity. My first attempt to conquer the challenge of the cube failed miserably. Instead of being frustrated with it, I decided to take apart the cube and learn how it worked from the inside out.</p>
            <br>
          <p>At first glance, the puzzle is composed of 54 squares that have stickers in blue, white, green, red, yellow, and orange. As I spent time taking apart each piece there turned out to be another story behind the mechanics of the cube. At the center of the puzzle was of a 6 spoked swiveling core. Each spoke had one color sticker and stayed stationary relative to the other pieces. On the corners were 8 pieces that comprised of 3 stickers each. Finally on the edges were 12 pieces that sat between corners and had two stickers. So in actuality there is really only 20 moving parts to the puzzle instead of 54. The solution comes from making sure corners and edges are placed correctly with their stationary center. While solving the puzzle was a thrill itself the process of taking things apart is what has stuck with me the most.</p>
            <br>
          <p>Almost all of the challenges in life are similar to this cube. These puzzles at first present us with a massive obstacle. As we take time to break down the pieces we begin to see a much simpler reality. What determines success is loving the process of learning. Only through enjoyment in our understanding can we overcome the problems of today. </p>
