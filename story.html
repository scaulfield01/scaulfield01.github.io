        <div class="well well-lg" id="story">You may have noticed I have a small interest in Erno Rubik, inventor of the Rubik Cube.

          The cube is nothing more 54 colored squares that come in purple, white, green, red, yellow, and orange.

          My first attempt to conquer the challenge of the cube failed miserably.

          Instead of giving up I decided to take apart the Cube and learn how it worked from the inside out.

          What I discovered was there are actually only 20 moving parts to the puzzle and the actual solution follows a simple pattern.

          While solving the puzzle was a thrill itself the process of taking things apart is what has stuck with me the most.

          Almost all of life’s challenges are similar to this cube.

          What matters most when met with challenges is having fun learning what we once couldn’t phatfom we could do before.  </div>
