      It was a humid summer day in late may of 2011. The air in suburban Philadelphia was filled with excitement. Young men and women were full of anticipation of the next step in their lives. There I sat drunk in a black robe and cheap cardboard hat  filled with a feeling I had never felt before, not knowing the next step. This feeling would follow me for a long time.

      I was armed with a degree in economics, but something inside of me said it wasn’t what I really want. I had listened to conventional wisdom of my family & friends and took a safe route doing something I neither enjoyed nor hated. This middle-ground of enjoyment became the way many jobs manifested themselves.

      What I came to realize through working 6 different jobs in 6 different industries is so long ago I lost my drive to create. Challenges only presented themselves once in a while and when they did I quickly became bored. I hadn’t had control of what I created since I painted as a child. The control of my creativity was immense but I lost my drive to paint and it just disappeared by the time I hit my teens. That being said, I found that drive again with something very mundane, Microsoft excel. After years of tediously using it I finally had enough and decided I must find a way to make my life easier.  It started off with a simple macro from stack overflow that would name my files. Soon I discovered I could find solutions to my job by my own creation. It was like I had a new canvas to paint my pictures on , but this time it made my life so much easier. That opened the door for me trying to learn more about what programmers really do on a day-to-day basis. It sparked me to have conversations and ask what exactly they were doing. The concept that they could create something together that made lives easier was exactly what I needed.

      Now I realize that is quite the tangent but my point is simple : I need to be challenged to create. This was the concept that excited me about the fireside chat. Hearing Shereef explain that bootcamp is a place where we create something and all take the reins of our own education together. Essentially we are creating our own path towards making our lives easier together. This is what draws me to this program, and is what gets me excited about what comes next. </p>
