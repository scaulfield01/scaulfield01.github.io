    -Describe version control
        Version control is the repository of files that contain code with controlled access.To break this down more simply when developers are working on teams they need a central location for the project's code. They need this file-storage location to have two primary features. The first feature is the location must allow multiple developers to work on projects at the same time. Secondly, they need to have a methodical way of tracking who changed what , why they changed it, how they changed, and when they changed it. These features are essential because it allows a team to be able to go back to older code and find solutions to past, present, and future problems. For example, if the code broke for a website this morning a team could use the last code that worked in the interim. Meanwhile they could examine the most recent changes and pinpoint where the error is occurring.

      -Explain how git tracks changes

        Git uses a system of branches that tracks changes. However, I don’t believe that a tree is and its branches is the best way to describe git. Personally my view fits best with the analogy of an imaginary road in the world of Mad Max that has a tentative destination of an oil oasis. All the developers on a team are a like group of raiders that are working together to find the oil’s location. They start their journey at a base camp in the desert. Everyday they all go out and diverge from the road to find better routes. Sometimes they find routes that lead them closer. Sometimes they find dead ends. As they go along the team of raiders carefully tracks each raiders progress so they can better augment their “oil treasure map” with each divergence. Sometimes they merge their primary route of the map with a route that is faulty. However they have a great well documented map that they can fall back on. In the end they will find the most efficient road map towards the oil and eventually they will be able to go back and forth between the oil and their home base.  To summarize git organizes how a team diverges and merges back together as they work towards their destination.

      -Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code

        The benefits to Github cannot be said without including git. Git is stored locally on a computers hard drive. Github is stored remotely online. The best comparison is as follows : Git is to hard drive as Github is to a cloud drive. The benefits of locally store items are not extremely evident when there is a team working on a project. However if items are stored online they are all easily accessible and more stable in the case of an emergency.
