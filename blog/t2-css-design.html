        <h2>CSS and the Three Positions</h2>
          <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language of the internet. It is the skeleton that forms each website you have ever viewed.  HTML essentially acts like an outline. By itself it very very limited. It essentially just produces a plain one columuned website(see below).</p>

          <p>Pretty basic right?</p>

          <p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is an amazing tool to format websites.While HTML is the backbone of web design CSS is the substance in the form of style. Essentially it is just a separate document that works with a HTML and styles it according to your liking rather than in the code.

          That being said my own experience learning CSS has been rather difficult. One of the reasons for this frustration is understanding the principle concepts of position. As an exercise I will now attempt to explain the use of the positions “relative", “absolute", and “fixed”.
          </p>
          <p>Before beginning to explain the aforementioned positions we must talk about the default, “Static”. This mean that all the elements will position themselves in the location they normally would occur. Just like the page shown earlier, this will keep things in a straight order.
          </p>
          <p>The “relative” position in CSS is one that allows you to manipulate a HTML Element  from where it would normally be. This means if we had a square on a page we can now enter in a position like 20 px right and it would move 20 pixels right from its “static” location. This does mean that elements can overlap each other depending on their location.
          </p>
          <p>The “absolute” position is one where you can put the element at any location on the page relative to the pages parent elements. With this positioning the item is removed from the HTML order. This element will not effect other element and other elements will not effect it.
          </p>
          <p>
          The <span class="postion">“fixed"</span> position is one that will resize and element according to the viewport of the browser. This means that depending on the size of a browser window the element will keep its position fixed regardless. This can be a useful effect because it can keep a navigation bar in the same location. That being said, if the element has a bad positioning it could also be irritating for users with smaller laptops.
          </p>

          This is my elementary understanding of the positions in CSS. One website that really helped me understand this concept is <a href="http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/">here</a>. It has a step by step explanation and it also offers an example of what the code would look like.
