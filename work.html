            <p>Node.js application that transforms raw S.F. public data into responsive visualization of city-wide bike parking, art installations, mobile food, historic film sites, and health inspection scores. Built in less than a week at Dev Bootcamp and presented to public audience. </p>

        <h3>Platform Game</h3>
        <p>Taken from the pages of Eloquent Javascript, this is an on-going side project I do in my free time. The game is a very simple platform game where the player must move their icon from one side of the screen to another. Overtime I hope to transform it into something with more than one level following a story. More to come! </p>

        <h3>Funding Circle Propreitary Application Imporation tool</h3>
        <p>This was the first program I ever wrote and it became used in production by an entire department. It is a Microsoft Excel Macro that uploaded text files from companyâ€™s internal website, migrated the data to an excel model, and performed initial risk analysis. This tool greatly cut the processing of time of our applications (by over 50%). It was what inspired me to solve more problems with code.</p>
